<p><p>Saliva drug test are very weak in detecting as to whether or not what might be in your system. So as for a short answer, you would most definitely pass that drug test. As a matter of fact, you probably could have smoked a week before, and still been fine. <br /><br /> That's the thing with cannabis though, no matter what you hear, answers are always different, so you never really can be sure. You can only go with what you hear the most, and even then leave a little bit of error room. Cannabis though depends on your weight, fat content, how much water you <a class="inlink_gtb" href="http://drinks.answers.com" title="drink">drink</a>, and how much you work out. There are other factors of course, but those are generally the main ones as for drug testing. You would've passed a urine drug test too actually. <br /><br /> There's no set time for how long a detectable amount stays in your system, but it's generally between 5-15 days, considering you do it once, after not doing it for say 3-4 weeks or so. The more you do it, the more it builds up, the longest it should stay in your system though, considering an extreme case, would be a month max. <br /><br /> Please keep in mind though these are all estimations, but educated ones with some error room added. ^^

<font style="COLOR: gray">Here are some things that changed while Rip Van Winkle was in his "deep sleep"</zzz><br /><br />After Rip awakens from his long sleep and returns to the village, he does not recognize the people he encounters. But not only their faces are new but also their fashions and the look of the village: It is larger, with rows of houses he had never seen. His own house is in a shambles now with no one living in it, and the inn he frequented is a hotel. His wife and old Vedder are dead. Others left the village and never came back. Everything is different, it seems; nothing is as it was. There has even been a revolutionary war in which America gained its independence from England and became a new country.

<p>Yes, in the early stages it can. When the oil of the plant, urushiol, remains on the skin, skin to skin contact with the affected area may spread the rash from person to person. It can also be spread through unwashed clothing that was in contact with urushiol from the plant or the skin. Once the oils are washed from or fully absorbed into the skin, it can no longer be passed from person to person.

<font style="COLOR: gray">The dust and pollen filter is behind the glove box. I recommend buying the genuine Honda service manual before you try any work on the van. Helm, Inc on line or feeBay are good sources for the manual.</zzz><br /><br /> It's not that hard to get at if the filter was changed in the past BUT if it's the first time you <br /> must do some tedious work. There is a peice of plactic behind the glove box door that must <br /> be removed (some folks use a Dremel tool or hacksaw blade but the manual says to use diagnol cutters)by cutting it along the two sides. Then a metal bracket must be slid down on <br /> one side by removing one small bolt on the right side (place a rag under the glove box to cover the kick panel that covers the fuse box to catch the bolt should it fall). I only loosened the other side to make it easier to swing down rather than try to remount it later). <br /><br /> Once all this is done you can access the filter. Wish Honda would have made this filter slide to the bottom instead. Would be easier to change out. You might need a long thin nozzle on a shop vac to remove dirt and leaves inside the channel for the filter once it's removed. <br /><br /> The dealers charge nearly $100 (spring of 2010 price) to change the filter. Once it's been done takes only 15 minutes to change the filter but they still charge this rate. You can get the filters at auto parts stores at less than half the dealer cost which is about $50 at the dealer. This job should be done often if you live in dusty areas or near trees. I'd suggest checking every 6 months or so if you live in these areas. <br /><br /> When I bought my used Odyseey the filter had never been changed (9 years old and 137,000 miles on it). It was pretty dirty but not moldy. From what I could see the evaporator coil for the A/C unit wasn't dirty. The previous owner had taken the van for air conditioning work at a Mienike Shop that had charged $700 to service the A/C unit but never changed this filter. Guy was ripped off. <br /><br /> I did some other work on the A/C system and found there is a solar sensor on top of the dashboard that works with the climate control system. Be sure to check that sensor (mine is bad and I'm going to replace it) because it thinks it's night time so it doesn't need a lot of A/C running (I guess to save fuel?). The output voltage stayed the same if the van was in the shade or direct sunlight. It is supposed to be a bit higher in the direct sunlight. The air <br /> output in the front of the van is not as cold as it should be. There are two evaporators in my van. There is a separate system in the back that can be controlled by passengers or from the driver's seat. <br /><br /> A symptom of the solar sensor being bad might show up in the Navigation screen not adjusting to daylight brightness when on automatic. Not sure of this but that was doing it in my van. I'm ordering the part in (late April of 2010 cost is about $35 at Majestic Honda on-line about $50 at local shop)
